# Monorepo Tools Performance Benchmark: Nx vs Turbo vs Lerna vs Lage vs Moon

**Comprehensive Performance Comparison of Popular JavaScript Monorepo Build Tools and Task Runners**

This repository contains an extensive, unbiased performance benchmark comparing the most popular monorepo management tools in the JavaScript ecosystem: **Nx**, **Turbo (Turborepo)**, **Lerna**, **Lage**, and **Moon**. Our benchmark focuses on real-world scenarios with cache restoration performance using a enterprise-scale codebase.

## üèóÔ∏è Benchmark Repository Architecture

Our test repository simulates a **medium-to-large enterprise monorepo** with:

### **Codebase Scale & Complexity**

- **5 shared buildable libraries** - Each containing 250 reusable components
- **5 Next.js applications** - Each built from 20 app-specific libraries
- **100 total libraries** - Each library contains 250 components
- **~26,000 total components** - Representing realistic enterprise scale

### **Real-World Enterprise Scenario**

This benchmark represents a **medium-sized enterprise repository**. Many organizations operate monorepos that are **10x larger** than this test case, making performance differences even more critical at scale.

## Benchmark & Results (January 17, 2025)

Run `pnpm run benchmark`. The benchmark will warm the cache of all the tools. We benchmark how quickly
Turbo/Nx/Lerna/Lage/Moon can figure out what needs to be restored from the cache and restores it.

These are the numbers using GitHub Actions runner:

- average lage time is: 11830.6
- average turbo time is: 9992.2
- average lerna (powered by nx) time is: 3407.0
- average moon time is: TBD (pending benchmark)
- average nx time is: 1849.4
- nx is 6.4x faster than lage
- nx is 5.4x faster than turbo
- nx is 1.8x faster than lerna (powered by nx)
- nx vs moon performance comparison: TBD

## üöÄ Performance Implications for Enterprise Development

### **Cache Restoration Speed Matters**

The benchmark measures **cache restoration performance** - how quickly each tool can:

1. **Analyze dependencies** and determine what needs to be rebuilt
2. **Restore cached artifacts** from previous builds
3. **Skip unnecessary work** and maximize development velocity

### **Real-World Impact**

For small to medium repositories, the performance differences may be acceptable across all tools. However, the **true performance benefits** emerge when:

- **Scaling to larger codebases** (10x+ the size of this benchmark)
- **Implementing distributed builds** across multiple machines
- **Optimizing CI/CD pipeline performance** for faster deployments
- **Improving developer experience** with faster local builds

## üéØ Developer Experience & Tool Integration

### **Terminal Output & User Interface**

A critical but often overlooked aspect of monorepo tools is **preserving the native development experience**:

**Test the difference yourself:**

- Run: `nx build crew --skip-nx-cache`
- Compare with: `turbo run build --scope=crew --force`

- **Automated Updates**: Dependabot + daily workflow for latest versions
- **Compatibility Testing**: Benchmarks run after updates to ensure stability

## ü§ù Contributing & Feedback

### **Found an Issue? We Welcome Contributions**

This benchmark aims to be **completely fair and unbiased**. If you discover:

- **Configuration issues** that disadvantage any tool
- **Edge cases** that don't represent realistic usage
- **Setup problems** that affect benchmark accuracy
- **Missing optimizations** for any tool

**Please submit a Pull Request!** Our goal is accurate, representative benchmarking that helps the community make informed decisions.

### **Benchmark Methodology**

We've specifically chosen:

- **Next.js applications** (favorable for Turborepo)
- **Cache restoration scenarios** (core strength of all tools)
- **No incremental builds**
- **Realistic enterprise scale** (26k components)

This ensures a **fair comparison** focused on each tool's core caching capabilities.

## üèÜ Conclusion

This benchmark provides **objective performance data** to help teams choose the right monorepo tool for their needs. Consider:

1. **Repository scale** - larger codebases amplify performance differences
2. **Team requirements** - distributed builds, DX, ecosystem integration
3. **Tool maturity** - community support, documentation, plugin ecosystem
4. **Long-term strategy** - migration paths, vendor support, development roadmap

**Performance is just one factor** in selecting monorepo tooling. Evaluate based on your team's specific requirements, existing infrastructure, and long-term architectural goals.
